# Simple Shell
Learning how to start coding your own shell.
## General
1. Unix Shell
-  a command-line interface to the Unix system that works by gathering the input from the users, executing the program based on the input from the users, and then displaying the output after the program’s execution.
---
2. Thompson Shell
- The first Unix shell.
- Created in 1971
- Created by Ken Thompson
---
3. Kenneth Lane Thompson
- an american pioneer of computer science
- he designed and implemented the original Unix operating system. He also invented the B programming language, the direct predecessor to the C programming language, and was one of the creators and early developers of the Plan 9 operating system.

4. Coding your own shell
- In Linux, an executable stored on disk is called a program, and a program loaded into memory and running is called a process. When a process is started, it is given a unique number called process ID (PID) that identifies that process to the system. The PPID is the PID of the process’s parent.
- A shell program is an application that allows interacting with the computer. In a shell the user 
can run programs and also redirect the input to come from a file and output to come from a 
file. Shells also provide programming constructions such as if, for, while, functions, variables 
etc. Additionally, shell programs offer features such as line editing, history, file completion, 
wildcards, environment variable expansion, and programing constructions.
